This allows Google to show you relevant ads, Amazon to recommend relevant products, and Netflix to recommend movies that you might like.  This lab will demonstrate how we can use Apache Spark to recommend movies to a user.  We will start with some basic techniques, and then use the [Spark MLlib][mllib] library's Alternating Least Squares method to make more sophisticated predictions.\n","#### For this lab, we will use a subset dataset of 500,000 ratings we have included for you into your VM (and on Databricks) from the [movielens 10M stable benchmark rating dataset](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). However, the same code you write will work for the full dataset, or their latest dataset of 21 million ratings.\n","#### In this lab:\n","#### *Part 0*: Preliminaries\n","#### *Part 1*: Basic Recommendations\n","#### *Part 2*: Collaborative Filtering\n","#### *Part 3*: Predictions for Yourself\n","#### As mentioned during the first Learning Spark lab, think carefully before calling `collect()` on any datasets.  When you are using a small dataset, calling `collect()` and then using Python to get a sense for the data locally (in the driver program) will work fine, but this will not work when you are using a large dataset that doesn't fit in memory on one machine.  Solutions that call `collect()` and do local analysis that could have been done with Spark will likely fail in the autograder and not receive full credit.\n","[mllib]: https://spark.apache.org/mllib/"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1a0yf3gfWZ3V"},"source":["### Code\n","#### This assignment can be completed using basic Python and pySpark Transformations and Actions.

In this part, you will learn how to use MLlib to make personalized movie recommendations using the movie data we have been analyzing.\n","#### We are going to use a technique called [collaborative filtering][collab]. Collaborative filtering is a method of making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating). The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on an issue, A is more likely to have B's opinion on a different issue x than to have the opinion on x of a person chosen randomly. You can read more about collaborative filtering [here][collab2].\n","#### The image below (from [Wikipedia][collab]) shows an example of predicting of the user's rating using collaborative filtering. At first, people rate different items (like videos, images, games). After that, the system is making predictions about a user's rating for an item, which the user has not rated yet. These predictions are built upon the existing ratings of other users, who have similar ratings with the active user. For instance, in the image below the system has made a prediction, that the active user will not like the video.\n","![collaborative filtering](https://courses.edx.org/c4x/BerkeleyX/CS100.1x/asset/Collaborative_filtering.gif)\n","[mllib]: https://spark.apache.org/mllib/\n","[collab]: https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Collaborative_filtering\n","[collab2]: http://recommender-systems.org/collaborative-filtering/"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"cFuw4NX6WZ4B"},"source":["#### For movie recommendations, we start with a matrix whose entries are movie ratings by users (shown in red in the diagram below).

For each user, we have ratings for only a subset of the movies.  With collaborative filtering, the idea is to approximate the ratings matrix by factorizing it as the product of two matrices: one that describes properties of each user (shown in green), and one that describes properties of each movie (shown in blue).\n","![factorization](http://spark-mooc.github.io/web-assets/images/matrix_factorization.png)\n","#### We want to select these two matrices such that the error for the users/movie pairs where we know the correct ratings is minimized.  The [Alternating Least Squares][als] algorithm does this by first randomly filling the users matrix with values and then optimizing the value of the movies such that the error is minimized.  Then, it holds the movies matrix constrant and optimizes the value of the user's matrix.  This alternation between which matrix to optimize is the reason for the \"alternating\" in the name.\n","#### This optimization is what's being shown on the right in the image above.  Given a fixed set of user factors (i.e., values in the users matrix), we use the known ratings to find the best values for the movie factors using the optimization written at the bottom of the figure.

We will use the [Root Mean Square Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation) (RMSE) or Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) to compute the error of each model.  RMSE is a frequently used measure of the differences between values (sample and population values) predicted by a model or an estimator and the values actually observed. The RMSD represents the sample standard deviation of the differences between predicted values and observed values. These individual differences are called residuals when the calculations are performed over the data sample that was used for estimation, and are called prediction errors when computed out-of-sample. The RMSE serves to aggregate the magnitudes of the errors in predictions for various times into a single measure of predictive power. RMSE is a good measure of accuracy, but only to compare forecasting errors of different models for a particular variable and not between variables, as it is scale-dependent.\n","####  The RMSE is the square root of the average value of the square of `(actual rating - predicted rating)` for all users and movies for which we have the actual rating. Versions of Spark MLlib beginning with Spark 1.4 include a [RegressionMetrics](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.mllib.html#pyspark.mllib.evaluation.RegressionMetrics) modiule that can be used to compute the RMSE. However, since we are using Spark 1.3.1, we will write our own function.\n","#### Write a function to compute the sum of squared error given `predictedRDD` and `actualRDD` RDDs. Both RDDs consist of tuples of the form (UserID, MovieID, Rating)\n","#### Given two ratings RDDs, *x* and *y* of size *n*, we define RSME as follows: $ RMSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2}{n}}$\n","#### To calculate RSME, the steps you should perform are:\n","* #### Transform `predictedRDD` into the tuples of the form ((UserID, MovieID), Rating).

Note that not every (UserID, MovieID) pair will appear in both RDDs - if a pair does not appear in both RDDs, then it does not contribute to the RMSE.
